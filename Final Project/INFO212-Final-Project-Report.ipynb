The analyzed results will be plotted showing relatinoships between the typing and statistics of Pokemon."

    "The stakeholders for this kind of project would be competitve players of the Pokemon video games who could use such data in putting their teams together. Additionally, it would appeal to the casual players of the game who argue with their friends regarding which pokemon starter type is strongest.\n",

    "This problem was derived from personal interest as I personal enjoy playing the Pokemon RPG games and lightly follow the competitve scene. Additionally, there have been many announcements regarding Pokemon on the Nintendo Switch and a newer pokemon game has been announced for 2019 as linked here - https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1001636250158223360. With all the excitement surrounding this game, I felt it was appropriate to take a look at the data of the current 802 Pokemon and potentially compare it to the updated set after the new game release in 2019."

    "* Set up data analysis environment by integrating commonly used practical tools and programming packages.   \n",
    "* Explain different types of data storages and formats and apply appropriate tools for extracting and transforming data.\n",
    "* Create interactive and programming code for cleansing, wrangling, reshaping, visualizing and analyzing various data sets. \n",
